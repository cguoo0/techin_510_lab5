# Techin-510_Lab3
This Lab3 is a practice of using API from google Gemini to create streamlit APP. I used Gemini API to create AI generated content based on users input. Users can enter their destination information and travel preference to get tailored trip suggestions

# Getting started
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py

# What's included
- API key
- travel planner based on users inputs, such as location, days of traveling, and their trip preference.
- Travel suggestions include their planing in a day and alternative plans based on their preference.

# What I learned
- I have learned how to use resources to get API key
- Learn how to create prompt for Gemini
- Learn how to connect API from front end to back end development.

# Questions
- How to better format the output content, and generate image based on the answer.
- How to create checklist or todo list.
